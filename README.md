# Fermat's Last Margin
A tool for annotating research papers (and more) and sharing those annotations (via git for starters)

[Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was captioned "I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain."

This this tool intends to be an infinite margin.

# What's the big idea?

## local annotations

1. [ ] turn each page of a PDF into an image
2. [ ] generate a wiki page for each page image
3. [ ] save annotations to git

## share with others

1. [ ] push local annotations to github (or wherever you like)
2. [ ] subscribe to other accounts via name convention (probably using DOI to name each git repo)

## view annotations from others

1. [ ] enter github usernames you wish to follow, when opening a DOI, check the account for a matching repo


# workflow

Enter the [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) of a document
